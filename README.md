# Automated-Vprofile
INTRODUCTION: DevOpsForge displays streamlined development with Oracle VM VirtualBox, Vagrant, GitBash, and Sublime Text. Seamlessly integrating Nginx, Apache Tomcat, RabbitMQ, Memcached, and MySQL, the project allows easy importing of web apps from GitHub. Recently, it transitioned to an online environment on AWS, leveraging EC2, ASG, ELB, IAM, ACM, Route 53, and S3. The web app is now accessible via a custom domain registered with GoDaddy.

STEPS:

1.Amazon: This section shows that Amazon Web Services (AWS) is being used to host the web application.

2.Route 53: This is a Domain Name System (DNS) service offered by AWS that routes traffic to the web application.

3.CloudWatch: This is a monitoring service offered by AWS that provides insights into the performance of the web application.

4.Artifacts in Bucket: This section refers to the Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket where the web applicationâ€™s code and other assets are stored.

5.Application Load Balancer: This distributes traffic among multiple instances of the web application.

6.Auto Scaling: This automatically scales the number of instances of the web application up or down based on demand.

7.Elastic Beanstalk: This is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering from AWS that simplifies the deployment and management of web applications.

8.Visualpath: This is a network monitoring tool that provides insights into the performance of the network that the web application is running on.

9.Amazon MQ: This is a message queueing service offered by AWS that enables asynchronous communication between different parts of the web application.

10.MySQL and Memcached: These are database management systems that are used to store data for the web application. MySQL is a relational database management system, while Memcached is a key-value store.
